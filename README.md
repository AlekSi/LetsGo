This is a slide deck for a talk "Let's Go, or introduction into Go" I gave at [RailsClubâ€™Ulyanovsk](http://railsclub.ru/conference) (other themes covered on this conference for (ex-)Rubists/Railsists: Erlang, functional programming and EventMachine). The talk and slides are in Russian.

Talk can be viewed [there](http://live.digicast.ru/view/1582) (starting at 14:35).

To view slides you should first [install Go](http://golang.org/doc/install) and [setup GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html). Then install `present` command with `go get code.google.com/p/go.talks/present`. Finally clone this repository (`git clone git://github.com/AlekSi/LetsGo.git`), run `present` in cloned directory and open http://127.0.0.1:3999/ in your browser.
